    HIGH: 5 issue(s)
    CRITICAL: 1 issue(s)

Vulnerability #1:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: apt
    Version: 2.6.1
    Description: It was found that apt-key in apt, all versions, do not correctly validate gpg keys with the master keyring, leading to a potential man-in-the-middle attack.

Vulnerability #2:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: bash
    Version: 5.2.15-2+b7
    Description: No description

Vulnerability #3:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: bsdutils
    Version: 1:2.38.1-5+deb12u3
    Description: A flaw was found in the util-linux chfn and chsh utilities when compiled with Readline support. The Readline library uses an "INPUTRC" environment variable to get a path to the library config file. When the library cannot parse the specified file, it prints an error message containing data from the file. This flaw allows an unprivileged user to read root-owned files, potentially leading to privilege escalation. This flaw affects util-linux versions prior to 2.37.4.

Vulnerability #4:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: coreutils
    Version: 9.1-1
    Description: chroot in GNU coreutils, when used with --userspec, allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal's input buffer.

Vulnerability #5:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: coreutils
    Version: 9.1-1
    Description: In GNU Coreutils through 8.29, chown-core.c in chown and chgrp does not prevent replacement of a plain file with a symlink during use of the POSIX "-R -L" options, which allows local users to modify the ownership of arbitrary files by leveraging a race condition.

Vulnerability #6:
    Severity: MEDIUM
    Package: curl
    Version: 7.88.1-10+deb12u8
    Description: When asked to both use a `.netrc` file for credentials and to follow HTTP
redirects, curl could leak the password used for the first host to the
followed-to host under certain circumstances.

This flaw only manifests itself if the netrc file has an entry that matches
the redirect target hostname but the entry either omits just the password or
omits both login and password.

Vulnerability #7:
    Severity: MEDIUM
    Package: curl
    Version: 7.88.1-10+deb12u8
    Description: When curl is asked to use HSTS, the expiry time for a subdomain might
overwrite a parent domain's cache entry, making it end sooner or later than
otherwise intended.

This affects curl using applications that enable HSTS and use URLs with the
insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like
`x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain
of the second host.

(The HSTS cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to
have been previous HTTPS accesses done as the cache needs to have entries for
the domains involved to trigger this problem.)

When `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers, this
bug can make the subdomain's expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the
parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache.

The result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get
converted to HTTPS for a different period of time than what was asked for by
the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting HTTPS at its
expiry time, curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the
(wrongly set) timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry
*earlier*, thus making curl inadvertently switch back to insecure HTTP earlier
than otherwise intended.

Vulnerability #8:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: curl
    Version: 7.88.1-10+deb12u8
    Description: libcurl skips the certificate verification for a QUIC connection under certain conditions, when built to use wolfSSL. If told to use an unknown/bad cipher or curve, the error path accidentally skips the verification and returns OK, thus ignoring any certificate problems.

Vulnerability #9:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: curl
    Version: 7.88.1-10+deb12u8
    Description: When asked to use a `.netrc` file for credentials **and** to follow HTTP
redirects, curl could leak the password used for the first host to the
followed-to host under certain circumstances.

This flaw only manifests itself if the netrc file has a `default` entry that
omits both login and password. A rare circumstance.

Vulnerability #10:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: curl
    Version: 7.88.1-10+deb12u8
    Description: When libcurl is asked to perform automatic gzip decompression of
content-encoded HTTP responses with the `CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING` option,
**using zlib 1.2.0.3 or older**, an attacker-controlled integer overflow would
make libcurl perform a buffer overflow.

Vulnerability #11:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: gcc-12-base
    Version: 12.2.0-14
    Description: libiberty/rust-demangle.c in GNU GCC 11.2 allows stack consumption in demangle_const, as demonstrated by nm-new.

Vulnerability #12:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: gcc-12-base
    Version: 12.2.0-14
    Description: **DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains 
that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer 
overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your application 
without this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies 
to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using 
alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized 
local variables.

The default behavior when the stack-protector 
detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in 
controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer 
overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change 
program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to
 go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.

Vulnerability #13:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: gpgv
    Version: 2.2.40-1.1
    Description: GnuPG can be made to spin on a relatively small input by (for example) crafting a public key with thousands of signatures attached, compressed down to just a few KB.

Vulnerability #14:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: libapt-pkg6.0
    Version: 2.6.1
    Description: It was found that apt-key in apt, all versions, do not correctly validate gpg keys with the master keyring, leading to a potential man-in-the-middle attack.

Vulnerability #15:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: libblkid1
    Version: 2.38.1-5+deb12u3
    Description: A flaw was found in the util-linux chfn and chsh utilities when compiled with Readline support. The Readline library uses an "INPUTRC" environment variable to get a path to the library config file. When the library cannot parse the specified file, it prints an error message containing data from the file. This flaw allows an unprivileged user to read root-owned files, potentially leading to privilege escalation. This flaw affects util-linux versions prior to 2.37.4.

Vulnerability #16:
    Severity: MEDIUM
    Package: libc-bin
    Version: 2.36-9+deb12u9
    Description: When the assert() function in the GNU C Library versions 2.13 to 2.40 fails, it does not allocate enough space for the assertion failure message string and size information, which may lead to a buffer overflow if the message string size aligns to page size.

Vulnerability #17:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: libc-bin
    Version: 2.36-9+deb12u9
    Description: The glob implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in STAT commands to an FTP daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.

Vulnerability #18:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: libc-bin
    Version: 2.36-9+deb12u9
    Description: In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.29, check_dst_limits_calc_pos_1 in posix/regexec.c has Uncontrolled Recursion, as demonstrated by '(\227|)(\\1\\1|t1|\\\2537)+' in grep.

Vulnerability #32:
    Severity: MEDIUM
    Package: libcap2
    Version: 1:2.66-4
    Description: The PAM module pam_cap.so of libcap configuration supports group names starting with “@”, during actual parsing, configurations not starting with “@” are incorrectly recognized as group names. This may result in nonintended users being granted an inherited capability set, potentially leading to security risks. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to achieve local privilege escalation on systems where /etc/security/capability.conf is used to configure user inherited privileges by constructing specific usernames.

Vulnerability #33:
    Severity: MEDIUM
    Package: libcurl4
    Version: 7.88.1-10+deb12u8

Vulnerability #40:
    Severity: MEDIUM
    Package: libgcrypt20
    Version: 1.10.1-3
    Description: A timing-based side-channel flaw was found in libgcrypt's RSA implementation. This issue may allow a remote attacker to initiate a Bleichenbacher-style attack, which can lead to the decryption of RSA ciphertexts.

Vulnerability #41:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: libgcrypt20
    Version: 1.10.1-3
    Description: cipher/elgamal.c in Libgcrypt through 1.8.2, when used to encrypt messages directly, improperly encodes plaintexts, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it does not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack). The Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption does not hold for Libgcrypt's ElGamal implementation.

Vulnerability #42:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: libgnutls30
    Version: 3.7.9-2+deb12u4
    Description: The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session, in conjunction with JavaScript code that uses (1) the HTML5 WebSocket API, (2) the Java URLConnection API, or (3) the Silverlight WebClient API, aka a "BEAST" attack.

    Description: A Memory Leak vulnerability exists in SQLite Project SQLite3 3.35.1 and 3.37.0 via maliciously crafted SQL Queries (made via editing the Database File), it is possible to query a record, and leak subsequent bytes of memory that extend beyond the record, which could let a malicious user obtain sensitive information. NOTE: The developer disputes this as a vulnerability stating that If you give SQLite a corrupted database file and submit a query against the database, it might read parts of the database that you did not intend or expect.

Vulnerability #85:
    Severity: MEDIUM
    Package: libssl3
    Version: 3.0.15-1~deb12u1
    Description: Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering
the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations
could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring
the timing would require either local access to the signing application or
a very fast network connection with low latency.

There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of
the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular
the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker
process must either be located in the same physical computer or must
have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason
the severity of this vulnerability is Low.

Vulnerability #86:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: libstdc++6
    Version: 12.2.0-14
    Description: libiberty/rust-demangle.c in GNU GCC 11.2 allows stack consumption in demangle_const, as demonstrated by nm-new.

Vulnerability #87:
    Severity: LOW
    Package: libstdc++6
    Version: 12.2.0-14
    Description: **DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains 
that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer 
overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your application 
without this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies 
to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using 
alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized 
local variables.

The default behavior when the stack-protector 
detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in 
controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer 
overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change 
program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to
 go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.

    Description: initscripts in rPath Linux 1 sets insecure permissions for the /var/log/btmp file, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information regarding authentication attempts.  NOTE: because sshd detects the insecure permissions and does not log certain events, this also prevents sshd from logging failed authentication attempts by remote attackers.

Vulnerability #100:

    Version: 1:4.13+dfsg1-1+b1
    Description: In Shadow 4.13, it is possible to inject control characters into fields provided to the SUID program chfn (change finger). Although it is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect, social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that "cat /etc/passwd" shows a rogue user account.

Vulnerability #101:
